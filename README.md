# Breaking-one-time-pad-cipher

Problem Statement: Let One-Time-Pad cipher is defined over the spaces = = = {0, 1} , where is the length 
of the binary strings. Show that the cipher is not secure under the chosen-plaintext attack. 
Furthermore, the attack should be implemented in your preferred programming language. 
Expected solution includes:
1. Algorithm used to break the cipher under the aforementioned attack model, 
2. Clear statement of the goal achieved by the attacker,
3. Code to implement the attack.
