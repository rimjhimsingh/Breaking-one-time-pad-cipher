# Breaking-one-time-pad-cipher

Problem Statement: Let One-Time-Pad cipher is defined over the spaces = = = {0, 1} , where is the length 
of the binary strings. Show that the cipher is not secure under the chosen-plaintext attack. 
Furthermore, the attack should be implemented in your preferred programming language. 
Expected solution includes:
1. Algorithm used to break the cipher under the aforementioned attack model, 
2. Clear statement of the goal achieved by the attacker,
3. Code to implement the attack.

Solution with explanation is included in otp.java
